# Node Groups

What is this?
A place to serve as a singular spot for all my blender nodes, either shaders or geometry nodes, so that it is easier to import into other projects.
As well as a place to keep track of all my imports incase my computer dies lmao for any reason.

    To use Node groups in your project:
    File > Append > Search for Exports/Shaders.blend or Exports/GeomeryNodes.blend > NodeTree

## Shaders
- Toon Shader
- Vertex Color Mask

## Geometry Nodes
- Surrounder
