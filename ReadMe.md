# Node Groups

What is this?

A place to serve as a singular spot for all my blender nodes. 
This includes both shader nodes and geometry nodes, so that it is easier to import them into other projects.
As well as a place to keep track of all my imports incase my computer dies lmao for any reason.

    To use a Node Group in your project:
    File > Append > Search for Exports/Shaders.blend or Exports/GeomeryNodes.blend > NodeTree

## Shaders
